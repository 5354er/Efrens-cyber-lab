# Efrens Cyber Lab - Raspberry Pi Web Server Project

## Description

This project demonstrates:

- A Raspberry Pi running Apache2 serving a custom `index.html` page.
- An Nmap scan performed from a Kali machine to identify open ports and OS details.

## Files

- `index.html`: Custom HTML page hosted on the Pi.
- `nmap_scan.txt`: Nmap output showing open ports on 192.168.0.14.

## Nmap Command Used

```bash
nmap -sS -O 192.168.0.14 -oN nmap_scan.txt

Example: Discovering an Open Port 80, 22, 5900 on Raspberry Pi via Kali Linux VM
While running a Kali Linux virtual machine inside VMware, I performed an Nmap scan against my Raspberry Pi's IP address. The scan revealed that port 80 (HTTP), 22 ssh, 5900 open.

This meant the Raspberry Pi was hosting a web server accessible over the network. By simply entering the Raspberry Pi’s IP address and port 80 into a browser (e.g., http://192.168.x.x:80), I could access the web page and using a web analyzer like Burpsuite if the page had a login credential could be extracted aswell as other personal information. Also, by having port 22 open anyone on my network could ssh into my PC and extract personal save files and perform a C2 attack.

This demonstrated a potential security risk because having port 80 open exposes the Raspberry Pi’s web interface to anyone on the network — potentially leaving it vulnerable to attacks if not properly secured.
