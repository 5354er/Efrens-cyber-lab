# Efrens Cyber Lab - Raspberry Pi Web Server Project

## Description

This project demonstrates:

- A Raspberry Pi running Apache2 serving a custom `index.html` page.
- An Nmap scan performed from a Kali machine to identify open ports and OS details.

## Files

- `index.html`: Custom HTML page hosted on the Pi.
- `nmap_scan.txt`: Nmap output showing open ports on 192.168.0.14.

## Nmap Command Used

```bash
nmap -sS -O 192.168.0.14 -oN nmap_scan.txt

Example: Discovering an Open Port 80 on Raspberry Pi via Kali Linux VM
While running a Kali Linux virtual machine inside VMware, I performed an Nmap scan against my Raspberry Pi's IP address. The scan revealed that port 80 (HTTP) was open.

This meant the Raspberry Pi was hosting a web server accessible over the network. By simply entering the Raspberry Pi’s IP address and port 80 into a browser (e.g., http://192.168.x.x), I could access the web page it was serving.

This demonstrated a potential security risk because having port 80 open exposes the Raspberry Pi’s web interface to anyone on the network — potentially leaving it vulnerable to attacks if not properly secured.
